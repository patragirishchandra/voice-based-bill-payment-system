# Voice-Based Bill Payment System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Voice-Based Bill Payment System** is an AI-powered solution designed to streamline bill payments through voice commands. This system integrates **Whisper** for Speech-to-Text (STT), **Llama 2.1** for Natural Language Understanding (NLU), and API integrations for fetching and processing bill payments in a seamless and secure manner. The system supports multiple Indian languages, ensuring accessibility for a diverse user base.

## 🔹 Features
- **🎙️ Voice Interaction** – Users can fetch and pay bills using voice commands.
- **🌍 Multilingual Support** – Supports multiple Indian languages for broader accessibility.
- **🤖 AI-Powered Assistance** – Utilizes Llama 2.1 for smart bill-related conversations.
- **🔐 Secure Transactions** – Integrates with APIs for reliable and safe payments.
- **⚡ Fast Processing** – Ensures bill payments within **10 seconds**.
- **🚫 Strict Domain Control** – AI only handles bill-related queries.

## 🔹 Technology Stack
- **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Whisper (for voice command recognition)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Llama 2.1 3B (for understanding user queries)
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI/Flask for API handling)
- **Database:** NoSQL (MongoDB) / SQL (PostgreSQL) for storing bill records
- **Integration:** REST APIs for fetching and processing bill payments
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub for source code management

## 🔹 How It Works
1. **User Speaks a Command** → "I want to check my electricity bill."
2. **Speech-to-Text Conversion** → Whisper transcribes speech into text.
3. **AI Processing** → Llama 2.1 understands and requests the bill number.
4. **Bill Fetching** → The system retrieves bill details from the database/API.
5. **User Confirmation** → The user confirms the bill payment.
6. **Payment Processing** → The system securely processes the payment.
7. **Acknowledgment** → AI confirms the payment and asks if further help is needed.

## 🔹 Use Cases
- **👴 Elderly or visually impaired users** who prefer voice commands.
- **🏃 Busy professionals** who want quick bill payments on the go.
- **🙌 Hands-free experience** for users who prefer a seamless bill payment solution.
